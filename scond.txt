I have studied the basics of system design, including how to approach high-level architectural decisions and identify key system components such as API gateways, databases, caching layers, and load balancers. I’ve explored common patterns for scalability and availability and am gaining familiarity with event-driven architecture concepts using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. I’ve also begun applying these principles in small-scale design discussions and POC projects, and I’m continuing to strengthen my practical understanding by analyzing the architecture of existing systems
