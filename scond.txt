I have studied Spring Boot in depth and applied it in multiple proof-of-concept (POC) projects to build RESTful APIs using Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with key backend concepts such as controller-service-repository architecture, request validation, exception handling, and basic database interactions using JPA. I am comfortable with core Java features like collections, streams, and lambdas, and I’m currently deepening my understanding of advanced topics like concurrency and JVM internals. I’ve also started exploring Spring Security, Docker, and basic CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions. While I’m still gaining practical experience in areas like caching, microservices architecture, and performance optimization, I have a good conceptual understanding and am actively building on these foundations
