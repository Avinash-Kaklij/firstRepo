Mid-Year Performance Summary
In my role as a Senior Trainee Associate at Western Union, I have made impactful contributions across development, production support, test automation, and feature flagging systems. I worked primarily with Java, Angular 14, SQL, and Oracle SQL, while also enhancing infrastructure and tooling used by the broader team.

Key Achievements:
ðŸ”§ Production Support & Feature Delivery
Resolved several high-priority production issues with deep root cause analysis and timely fixes.

Delivered full-stack features using Java (Spring Boot) and Angular 14, with a focus on clean, maintainable code and strong alignment to business requirements.

ðŸ§ª Test Automation (Playwright)
Revamped the Playwright test suite to include HAR recording logic.

Enabled environment-specific control over HAR usage and updates via environment variables, improving test reliability and CI/CD flexibility.

Simplified test data sharing via JSON and Excel, enabling quick setup and easier test case creation for developers.

ðŸš€ Feature Flag Management (Flagsmith)
Spearheaded the integration of Flagsmith for dynamic feature flag management in development and production environments.

Built a Java-based Flagsmith service to fetch and evaluate flags efficiently.

Designed logic for managing feature flags per Agent Profile ID, allowing granular control and faster experimentation.

Contributed to plans for a UI-based configuration tool to handle bulk segment creation, flag updates, and flag status management via the Flagsmith REST API.

ðŸ§  Innovation & Collaboration
Developed a Chrome extension to auto-fill forms with static test dataâ€”enhancing QA/testing efficiency for internal users.

Mentored peers on using the updated test and flag systems, improving team productivity and reducing onboarding time.

How I Achieved This:
Combined my backend, frontend, and DevOps knowledge to solve problems end-to-end.

Took ownership beyond assigned responsibilities by identifying gaps and proactively implementing solutions.

Continuously collaborated with QA, product owners, and fellow developers to ensure that every change delivered real value.

Maintained a focus on scalability, reusability, and maintainability in every technical decision.
