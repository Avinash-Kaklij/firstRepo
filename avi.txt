Great! Here's a **clean, structured version** of your mid-year performance summary, organized by work areas and responsibilities:

### **Mid-Year Performance Summary**

As a **Senior Trainee Associate** at Western Union, I contributed extensively as part of the **L3 engineering team**, took initiative on Proof of Concepts (POCs), and supported infrastructure improvementsâ€”especially around **test automation and feature flag management**. Below is a structured breakdown of my contributions:

---

#### ðŸ”§ **1. L3 Production Support & Issue Resolution**

* Worked as part of the L3 developer team to **resolve high-priority production issues** across:

  * **Frontend** (Angular 14): Fixed UI bugs affecting business flows and customer interactions.
  * **Backend** (Java, Spring Boot): Diagnosed and fixed logic issues and integration errors.
  * **Database** (Oracle SQL): Analyzed and resolved query-related or data inconsistency issues.
* Ensured minimal downtime by performing **root cause analysis** and delivering fast, reliable fixes under pressure.

---

#### ðŸš€ **2. Extra Initiatives & Proof of Concept Work**

* **Flagsmith Feature Flag Integration:**

  * Built a **Java-based service** for fetching and evaluating feature flags from Flagsmith.
  * Implemented **Agent Profile ID-based flag logic**, enabling granular configuration per user profile.
  * Planned a UI tool (POC stage) to support bulk segment creation and dynamic flag updates using Flagsmith's REST API.
* **Chrome Extension for Form Autofill (POC):**

  * Developed a lightweight extension to autofill internal forms with static test dataâ€”improving testing speed for QA and developers.

---

#### ðŸ§ª **3. Test Automation Ownership (Playwright)**

* Maintained and enhanced the existing **Playwright test framework**:

  * Introduced support for **HAR recording/playback** with environment-variable control (local vs CI/CD behavior).
  * Made the HAR logic dynamic per test case and modularized setup for better reusability.
  * Improved **test data handling** via JSON and Excel integration, making test setup developer-friendly.
* Collaborated with other developers to ensure smooth onboarding to the updated framework and troubleshoot automation issues.

---

### **Summary of Impact**

* Demonstrated strong **problem-solving ability**, especially in high-stakes production scenarios.
* Took **ownership beyond core responsibilities**, contributing to tooling, automation, and internal innovation.
* Ensured high code quality, reusability, and maintainability across all work areas.
* Actively collaborated across teams to deliver robust, scalable solutions.
