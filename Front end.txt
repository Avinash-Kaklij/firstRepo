Backend Development Skills
API Design and Development:
Learn to design robust and RESTful APIs with clear documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI), proper versioning, and error handling.
Study best practices for designing idempotent APIs and handling concurrency.
Explore GraphQL for efficient querying and optimizing backend-to-frontend communication.
Advanced Java Programming:
Deepen knowledge in areas like:
Concurrency and Parallelism: Master Java threads, CompletableFuture, ForkJoinPool, and Executor frameworks.
Stream APIs and Functional Programming: Use them for efficient, concise, and parallel data processing.
Reactive Programming: Learn frameworks like Project Reactor or RxJava for handling asynchronous data streams.
Database Optimization:
Study advanced SQL features like CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, and query plans to optimize database operations.
Learn to design database schemas for high-performance applications, including normalization, denormalization, and indexing strategies.
Security Best Practices:
Learn secure backend development practices, such as input validation, token-based authentication (OAuth2, JWT), and securing sensitive information like API keys.
Explore Spring Security to implement authorization and authentication in Java-based systems.

Design Architecture Skills
System Design Basics:
Learn to design scalable, maintainable, and robust systems by understanding key concepts like load balancing, caching, database sharding, and microservices architecture.
Study design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Repository) and how to implement them effectively in real-world projects.
High-Level Architecture Design:
Focus on scalability and resiliency by designing distributed systems that handle high traffic and fault tolerance using techniques like circuit breakers and message queues.
Practice designing systems from scratch, such as URL shorteners, e-commerce platforms, or ride-sharing apps.
Event-Driven Architecture:
Gain familiarity with event-driven systems using message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS. Learn to design architectures that decouple services while maintaining real-time communication.
